              <h3>RIGHTEOUS REBELLION</h3>
              <h2>NASIKE LENGUPAE'S FIGHT AGAINST FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION</h2>
              <p>
                Nasike Legupa is a 10-year-old girl from Samburu County in
                Northern Kenya. She lost both parents when she was still a
                little girl with the mother dying first followed by the
                step-father a few years later.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her life has been, in her words, “a bird’s life. … you see a
                bird doesn’t know what it will eat and probably not where it
                will sleep on any single day and sometimes it has to perch and
                even sleep on a thorny shrub” She means having parents or not is
                still the same for her as she quips. Why so? Nasike’s mother was
                mentally ill when Nasike was born. So she took no care of her
                and her step-father on the other hand didn’t care since it is
                not the work of Turkana men to take care of little and even
                older children! That is women’s work! In her early childhood,
                life was very difficult for her. She depended on the goodwill of
                relatives and friends to survive. In the circumstances, she did
                not even join school when she attained school going age.
              </p>
              <p>
                There was nobody to enroll her in school nor get her the mere
                basics like school uniform, registration fees and books, let
                alone other girl’s needs.

                The height of frustration came when one day, just before dawn,
                her father came home with a group of old women and some older
                men whose agenda was clear to her. The women were on mission to
                carry out Female Genital Mutilation on her while one of the old
                men in tow would immediately declare her an adult after the cut
                and therefore, his wife! She shivered with fear and trepidation.
                Thinking quickly, she slithered through a space in the walls of
                her hut and vanished into the darkness never to return. Her
                athletic legs helped her to outrun her pursuers as the elders
                went after baying for her blood. All that trailed her were
                shrill shouts of bloody-over thirty women and men pursuing but
                they were no match for her. They lost and she won this first
                battle. Later she leant that her father died. Perhaps he could
                not bear the frustration of losing dowry after Nasike escaped,
                and the shame of being branded a father of a coward!
              </p>
              <p>
                Before this incident, Nasike had been hearing from other girls
                that life was good, “in the big city, that had something called
                electricity, a lot of water and fashionable things’, that every
                girl fancied. The city they referred to is, Samburu county
                headquarters Maralal. She had been misled to believe that she
                could get work as a house help. She walked for days through
                dangerous wilderness asking for directions to the city and
                finally got to her destination without any idea where to start,
                what to drink or eat.
              </p>
              <p>
                She had no idea that it was illegal for anyone to employ a minor
                as that would be child-labor. So she didn’t get what brought
                her, a job as a house help! The, “big city”, wasn’t as rosy as
                painted by her age mates. Whereas community back in the village
                seemed to care and she could get food and a place to sleep in
                any household she walked into, in town life was different.
                People were indifferent, mean and exploitative. Some adults even
                attempted to molest her sexually and she had to keep ducking
                them in the dark and cold streets where she slept in the company
                of other street children.

                For some time, she lived here but she didn’t quite get used as a
                result of the many dangers that larked in the shadows,
                especially attempts by fellow male children to gang rape her and
                other girls. Together with other children, they survived on
                begging in the streets and rummaging food waste from dust bins.
                Luckily, small eateries owned by her tribesmen gave them left
                over food and this helped them to survive.
              </p>
              <p>
                Help came in disguise when one day, in the wee hours of the
                morning, the local police raided their hideout and took them
                away, into a local recue center run by the Catholic Church
                Sisters known as Suguta Girls Rescue Centre Centre in Samburu.
                This became her new home where there was sanity, caring Sisters
                (nuns), a place to sleep and food.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here she was also happy to learn abit of Kiswahili (National
                language) through the help of the Catholic sisters. This helped
                her be able to communicate with other people. But she still,
                missed a family she could identify with. The Rescue Center is
                where Shared Values Foundation team met Nasike Legupae during a
                familiarization tour of the County. We had visited the Rescue
                Center because the center is the run-to as well as receiving
                center for girls running away from female genital mutilation. We

            The first girl we met was Nasike Legupae who came running to us into
            the warm hug of our team lead, Ms. Lucy Kathurima. The hug lasted
            what appeared like an eternity as the girl could not let go off the
            visitor. When she finally loosed her grip and looked Lucy in the
            face, her first words, heavy with yearning, were, “mom, buy me
            clothes for Christmas so that I look like other lucky girls.” The
            next staccato sentence was, “please take me to school”. She meant
            that she yearned to join a school as the Rescue Center was for her,
            ‘a sort of prison’,.

                The Centre didn’t have a school and it was overcrowded. But the
                nuns were surely doing what had to be done to get the street and
                gang life out of the girls, and mentor Female Genital Mutilation
                survivors... After Nasike regained herself from what appeared
                like a torpor, we sat to hear her story above, told between
                breaks of sobs and tears.
              </p>
              <p>
                Later we spoke to many of her rescue center-mates and their
                stories were heart rending as some had actually been forcefully
                cut against their will and married off even before healing their
                wounds, some were forced to consummate their forced marriages
                while still bleeding from their fresh cuts; some with young
                babies; while the unlucky-lucky ones were banished from their
                homes, family and community for, “defying the elders and shaming
                their community by their cowardly acts!” After the long day of
                hearing depressing stories of cruelty against children in the
                name of culture, it was time to leave.
              </p>
              <p>
                We promised Nasike that we would take her to a nice boarding
                school with other beautiful girls , beautiful school uniform,
                building like those of the city she dreamt of and caring parents
                like the kind nuns who rescued her from the madness of the town
                streets. But we made it clear that we had to get permission from
                her current parents (meaning the nuns in charge of the center)
                who recommended that we take her to a school close to us so that
                we can be paying her visits. We took her a school managed by the
                same Mary Immaculate congregation. When we returned to Nairobi,
                SVF mobilized resources and secured Nasike a place in Mary
                Immaculate Girls Boarding school in Mweiga, Nyeri. Since she
                only had little knowledge of Kiswahili and English acquired from
                Mary Immaculate Rescue Centre, she could only start at grade 2
                despite her age of 10 years, which was overage for grade 2.

              <p>
                Her joy of wearing a new uniform – the only new (not second hand
                clothes) she had ever worn in her life and joining a new, “big”
                school was the greatest joy of her life….

                And SVF’s greatest joy too. Follow-up by SVF, which continues to
                support her school fees and personal needs, shows that Nasike
                settled down very fast and is a well behaved girl having
                received love and acceptance from a school she calls home. What
                isn’t more, she is doing well in school.

                She aspires to perform well in school, advance her studies and
                become a lawyer. Your guess is as good as ours why she wants to
                be a lawyer. From then on, Nasike Legupae has become SVF’s
                symbol of our determination to fight the FGM scourge and to lend
                a hand to victims of this retrogressive cultural practice and

                Other girls left at Suguta Girls Rescue Centre Center are also

                as many as we can as they also need clothing, food, fees and
                personal effects and parental love. Remember, almost all of them
                are neglected by their families for defying parents, community
                and cultural requirement to be, “made women and good wives”,
                through the cut. Join us to support Nasike Legupae and other
                Mary Rescue Center and out in other 21 FGM hot spots in Kenya

                Genital Mutilation.
